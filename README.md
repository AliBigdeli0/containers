# Start Note
I will put all of my self designed containers here. All containers here is designed on basic linux container such as `ubuntu` and `debian`. I'm working with all of this containers here in my daily basis so they are tested enough.

Another important note about the containers is that all of these containers designed for software developers who want to develop their softwares on safe environments (not for those who want to deploy their softwares). As a result, all containers will start with `bash shell` to give enough access to developers for any changes.
