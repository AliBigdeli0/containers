# Start Note
All containers here are designed on basic Linux containers such as `Ubuntu` and `Debian`. I work with all of these containers daily, so they are thoroughly tested.

Another important note about the containers is that they are all designed for software developers who want to develop their software in safe environments (not for those who want to deploy their software). As a result, all containers will start with `bash shell` to give enough access to developers for any changes.
