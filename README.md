# Start Note
All containers here are designed on basic Linux containers such as `ubuntu` and `Debian`. I'm working with all of these containers here daily so they are tested enough.

Another important note about the containers is that they are all designed for software developers who want to develop their software in safe environments (not for those who want to deploy their software). As a result, all containers will start with `bash shell` to give enough access to developers for any changes.
